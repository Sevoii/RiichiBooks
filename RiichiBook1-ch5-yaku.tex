\thispagestyle{fancy}

\bigskip
As we saw in the previous chapter, we often face a tradeoff between speed (tile efficiency) and hand value. In modern Riichi Mahjong, the value of pursuing expensive {\jap yaku} is much diminished because of red fives. 
For example, {\jap ryanpeiko} (Twice Pure Double Chow) is a beautiful three-{\jap fan yaku}, but it is extremely difficult to make this {\jap yaku}. We can achieve the same hand value more easily with {\jap riichi} + {\jap dora} + one red five. We thus tend to think of expensive {\jap yaku} as something that emerges in a hand (almost) by chance, not something we actively pursue. 
Given that we can get high scores also from {\jap ippatsu}, {\jap ura dora}, and {\jap tsumo}, getting the hand ready for {\jap riichi} is generally more important than pursuing expensive {\jap yaku}. 

\bigskip
That being said, always trying to maximize tile efficiency without regard for {\jap yaku} is not the best strategy, either. We should thus design a five-block configuration with an eye to possible {\jap yaku} we can reasonably get. Moreover, sometimes situations call for an expensive hand. For example, when you are ranked fourth in South-4, and the player who is currently ranked third has 10000 more points than you do, you should aim for {\jap mangan tsumo} or {\jap haneman ron} to improve the placement (more on this in Chapter \ref{ch:grand}), which will require that your hand has some {\jap yaku} other than just {\jap riichi} and {\jap dora}.

In this chapter, I will discuss some tips to get the following five set of {\jap yaku}.

\section{How to get {\jap sanshoku}} \index{sanshoku@{\jap sanshoku}} \label{sec:san}

{\jap Sanshoku} (Mixed Triple Chow) is an elusive {\jap yaku}. 
Even when we make our hand ready for {\jap sanshoku}, we may lose it at the very last minute. For example, suppose we manage to get the hand ready for {\jap sanshoku} of 345, and we have a side-wait protorun {\large\wan{4}\wan{5}} as the final wait. We will get {\jap sanshoku} only if we win the hand on a {\large\wan{3}}; if we win on a {\large\wan{6}}, we will lose {\jap sanshoku}.

\bigskip
On the other hand, it is possible to have a confirmed {\jap sanshoku}, but doing so often entails a significant loss in tile efficiency. For example, if our wait were a closed-wait protorun {\large\wan{3}\wan{5}} instead, {\jap sanshoku} is confirmed; but, a closed wait of {\large\wan{4}} is not very good. As long as we seek to utilize side waits to maximize tile efficiency, {\jap sanshoku} becomes difficult to achieve. I will discuss the following seven methods to capture this elusive {\jap yaku}.

\subsection{Floating}\label{sec:san1}

\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap sanshoku} 1}

\ep
\vspace{-10pt} What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}
\noindent
The {\large\wan{3}} in this hand is essentially a redundant floating tile from a pure tile efficiency perspective; we do not need it to accept {\large\wan{4}}. However, if we keep it and discard the {\large\bei} instead, we can hope to get {\jap sanshoku} of 345. The best case scenario is to draw a {\large\wan{4}} first, after which we discard the {\large\wan{6}}. 

\bigskip
That being said, keeping a floating tile this way is a risky strategy. What if an opponent calls {\jap riichi} after we discard the {\large\bei}? We will have to discard either the {\large\wan{3}} or the {\large\wan{6}} against the {\jap riichi}-ed player when this hand becomes ready. To make things worse, if we draw a {\large\suo{2}} first, we will have to discard the potentially dangerous {\large\wan{3}} (instead of {\large\bei}) with no benefit of getting {\jap sanshoku}. 

\bigskip
Moreover, when we draw a {\large\suo{5}} first, a difficult question arises. Consider the following hand. 
\bp
\wan{3}\wan{5}\wan{6}\tong{3}\tong{4}\tong{5}\suo{1}\suo{1}\suo{3}\suo{4}\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}~\suo{5}\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
Should we discard the {\large\wan{6}} and have a closed-wait hand in hopes of getting {\jap sanshoku}, or should we discard the {\large\wan{3}} and give up on {\jap sanshoku} in pursuit of tile efficiency?
If a hand has at least one {\jap dora} or {\jap tanyao} (All Simples), we should discard the {\large\wan{3}} to choose a side wait {\jap pinfu} hand. Only when there is no other {\jap yaku} or {\jap dora} in a {\jap pinfu} hand, it is OK to choose closed wait {\jap sanshoku} over side-wait {\jap pinfu}.\footnote{We will talk more about a tradeoff of this kind in Chapter \ref{ch:riichi}.}
\\

\begin{itembox}[c]{{\jap sanshoku}: floating}
Keeping a floating tile to aim for {\jap sanshoku} is risky. Give it up and pursue tile efficiency if a hand already has two {\jap fan} or more.

\subsection{Switching} \label{sec:san2}
\index{1-away (1-{\jap shanten})!perfect 1-away}

\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap sanshoku} 2}

\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}
\noindent
The hand already has five tile blocks and all the blocks are strong; in fact, this is a perfect 1-away hand.\footnote{For a definition of perfect 1-away, see Section \ref{sec:perfect}.} It is thus OK to discard the {\large\tong{3}} we just drew. After all, that is the best discard from a tile efficiency perspective. 

\bigskip
However, if we need an expensive hand, we can keep the {\large\tong{3}} and discard a {\large\tong{8}} instead. The resulting loss in tile efficiency is not very big, as we would still have a strong 1-away hand with two side-wait protoruns: {\large\tong{7}\tong{8}} and {\large\suo{4}\suo{5}}. In addition, the {\large\tong{3}} serves as a floating tile to approach {\jap sanshoku} of 234. 
Keep in mind that we should give up on {\jap sanshoku} and do insta-{\jap riichi} if we draw any of {\large\tong{6}\tong{9}\suo{3}\suo{6}} first (unless you absolutely need {\jap mangan} or above to improve the placement in South-4). 

\bigskip
On the other hand, if we draw a {\large\tong{2}} or a {\large\tong{4}} first, the hand will be 1-away from ready for {\jap sanshoku}. For example, with a draw of a {\large\tong{4}}, the hand becomes the following. 
\bp
\wan{2}\wan{3}\wan{4}\wan{6}\wan{6}\tong{3}\tong{7}\tong{8}\suo{2}\suo{3}\suo{4}\suo{4}\suo{5}~\tong{4}\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
We should discard the {\large\tong{7}} and then {\large\tong{8}} to aim for {\jap sanshoku} of 234. We are switching from one protorun {\large\tong{7}\tong{8}} to another protorun {\large\tong{3}\tong{4}} to approach {\jap sanshoku}. 

\bigskip
The key here is that we are keeping the hand 1-away throughout the entire process of switching from a perfect 1-away hand to a {\jap sanshoku} 1-away hand. You should not pursue {\jap sanshoku} if switching requires reverting a 1-away hand to 2-away.

\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}
\noindent
As we have two blocks in Cracks and another two blocks in Dots, we only need one block in Bamboos. Our choice is thus between (a) keeping a side-wait protorun {\large\suo{2}\suo{3}} to maximize tile efficiency and (b) keeping a double closed block {\large\suo{3}\suo{5}\suo{7}} in hopes of getting {\jap sanshoku} of 567. 

\bigskip
If the hand has at least one {\jap dora} or some {\jap yaku} (such as {\jap tanyao}), we should give up {\jap sanshoku} and discard {\large\suo{5}\suo{7}}. Only if the hand has no other {\jap yaku} or {\jap dora}, it is OK to discard {\large\suo{2}} to aim for {\jap sanshoku}. 

\bigskip
Keep in mind, though, that pursuing {\jap sanshoku} with a hand like this is risky, even compared with the floating method we discussed in \ref{sec:san1}. We will end up with a bad-wait {\jap yaku}-less hand if we draw a {\large\wan{4}} first. If we give up on {\jap sanshoku} sooner and choose the side-wait protorun {\large\suo{2}\suo{3}}, we can at least get {\jap pinfu}.

Notice that this hand has two possibilities of {\jap sanshoku}, 567 or 678, and we do not know at this point which one we can get. An excellent way to aim for {\jap sanshoku} with a hand like this is to discard the {\large\wan{4}} to have a stretched single block {\large\wan{5}\wan{6}\wan{7}\wan{8}} that contains both 567 and 678. 

\bigskip

\end{itembox}
\noindent
As we have one block in Cracks and two blocks in Bamboos, we need to have two blocks in Dots. More specifically, we need the head and a meld (preferably a run) in Dots. 
We therefore view the tiles in Dots not as a collection of three pairs but as a collection of one pair {\large\tong{6}\tong{6}} and two side-wait protoruns {\large\tong{3}\tong{4}} + {\large\tong{3}\tong{4}}. 

\bigskip
From a pure tile efficiency perspective, discarding a {\large\tong{3}} and discarding a {\large\tong{4}} are equally good, and they are better than any other discards. However, there is a clear difference between the two from a perspective of hand value. 
Suppose we discard a {\large\tong{3}} first. If we then draw a {\large\tong{5}}, we will get the following hand.
\bp
\wan{4}\wan{5}\tong{3}\tong{4}\tong{4}\tong{6}\tong{6}\suo{4}\suo{5}\suo{6}\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}~\tong{5}\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
Discarding a {\large\tong{4}} makes this hand ready, but it is just a {\jap pinfu}-only hand. On the other hand, suppose we had discarded a {\large\tong{4}} before drawing a {\large\tong{5}}. 
\bp
\wan{4}\wan{5}\tong{3}\tong{3}\tong{4}\tong{6}\tong{6}\suo{4}\suo{5}\suo{6}\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}~\tong{5}\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
We can make this hand ready for {\jap pinfu} and {\jap sanshoku} of 456 by discarding a {\large\tong{6}}. 

\bigskip
Note that pre-committing to {\jap sanshoku} of 456 by discarding a {\large\tong{6}} before drawing a {\large\tong{5}} is massively inefficient. If we do that, the hand becomes the following very weak hand. 
\bp
\wan{4}\wan{5}\tong{3}\tong{3}\tong{4}\tong{4}\tong{6}\suo{4}\suo{5}\suo{6}\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}
\ep
This hand relies too much on the possibility of drawing a {\large\tong{5}} first. If we draw any of {\large\wan{3}\wan{6}\tong{3}\tong{4}} first, the hand will be a {\jap yaku}-less and/or bad-wait hand.

It is called ``golden'' because the hand is 1-away from ready for {\jap sanshoku} \emph{and} 1-away from ready for {\jap ittsu} (Pure Straight), two of the most popular two-{\jap fan yaku} in Riichi Mahjong. 
Drawing a {\large\tong{1}} or a {\large\tong{6}} makes the hand ready for {\jap ittsu}, whereas drawing a {\large\wan{7}} or a {\large\wan{9}} makes the hand ready for {\jap sanshoku} of 789. The following are examples of golden 1-away.

This might sound crazy, but look how good a 1-away hand it becomes.

\section{How to get {\jap ittsu}}\label{sec:itt}
	\index{ittsu@{\jap ittsu}}

{\jap Ittsu} (Pure Straight) is another popular two-{\jap fan yaku}. As we will see below, even when {\jap ittsu} \emph{appears} to be a possibility, it is not always worthwhile to pursue this {\jap yaku} at the cost of tile efficiency. We will see several instances where pursuing {\jap ittsu} is and is not worth the cost.

\subsection{Two non-overlapping runs}
The key to getting {\jap ittsu} is to pay attention to {\bf two non-overlapping runs} in a given suit. For example, suppose a hand has two non-overlapping runs such as the following. 

%\bigskip 
%\begin{table}[h]\centering
%\begin{tabular}{ccc}
%{\Large\wan{1}\wan{2}\wan{3}+\wan{5}\wan{6}\wan{7}}&
%{\Large\tong{2}\tong{3}\tong{4}+\tong{6}\tong{7}\tong{8}}&
%{\Large\suo{3}\suo{4}\suo{5}+\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}}\\
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}

{\begin{center}\LARGE
\wan{1}\wan{2}\wan{3}+\wan{5}\wan{6}\wan{7}\\
\tong{2}\tong{3}\tong{4}+\tong{6}\tong{7}\tong{8}\\
\suo{3}\suo{4}\suo{5}+\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}\\
\end{center}}

%\bigskip
%{\Large \wan{1}\wan{2}\wan{3}+\wan{5}\wan{6}\wan{7}}  \hfill 
%{\Large \tong{2}\tong{3}\tong{4}+\tong{6}\tong{7}\tong{8}} \hfill
%{\Large \suo{3}\suo{4}\suo{5}+\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}} 
%\bigskip

\noindent
Then, as soon as we draw another non-overlapping tile in the same suit,  {\jap ittsu} is almost around the corner. 
Consider the following hand. 

\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap ittsu} 1}
\bp
\wan{1}\wan{2}\wan{3}\wan{5}\wan{6}\wan{7}\tong{6}\tong{8}\tong{8}\suo{2}\suo{4}\suo{6}\suo{6}~\wan{9}\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}
\noindent
From a pure tile efficiency perspective, the best discard choice is the {\large\wan{9}}.
However, doing so means giving up on {\jap ittsu} and poking our way toward a bad-wait {\jap yaku}-less hand. That is not a very good path to take even when we are ahead of the game in South-4 and don't need an expensive hand.\footnote{We would still want to have at least one {\jap yaku} in a hand so that we can win it without calling {\jap riichi}.}

\bigskip
We should rather treat the {\large\wan{9}} as a treasure; we now have a realistic possibility of getting {\jap ittsu}. Let's apply the five-block method to figure out an alternative discard.
\bmj{\huge
$ 
\underbrace{\text{\wan{1}\wan{2}\wan{3}}}
\underbrace{\text{\wan{5}\wan{6}}}
\underbrace{\text{\wan{7}\wan{9}}}
\underbrace{\text{\tong{6}\tong{8}\tong{8}}}
\underbrace{\text{\suo{2}\suo{4}\suo{6}\suo{6}}}
\nonumber
$
}\emj
We are hoping to get three blocks in Cracks to have {\jap ittsu}, so we need one block in Dots and another block in Bamboos. Recall the principle that each block should have at most three tiles, which suggests we discard one tile from the block in Bamboos. The choice now boils down to discarding a {\large\suo{6}} or the {\large\suo{2}}. Recall also that the value of pairs is maximized when there are two pairs in a hand. We should thus discard the {\large\suo{2}}. 

\subsection{Six-tile block with intervals}
Consider different six-tile configurations where we have a chunk of six tiles with a few intervals among them. For example, consider the following six-tile blocks. 

{\begin{center}
{\LARGE\wan{1}\wan{2}+\wan{4}\wan{6}+\wan{7}\wan{9}}\\ [\sep]
{\LARGE\tong{1}\tong{3}+\tong{5}\tong{6}+\tong{8}\tong{9}}\\ [\sep]
{\LARGE\suo{1}\suo{3}+\suo{4}\suo{6}+\suo{7}\suo{9}}
\end{center}}

\noindent
We do see {\jap ittsu} on the horizon with each of these tile chunks, but aiming for {\jap ittsu} with these blocks is not very realistic. Take the first six-tile block in Cracks, for example. Even when we draw a {\large\wan{8}}, we would want to discard the {\large\wan{1}} to have a double closed block {\large\wan{2}\wan{4}\wan{6}} and a run {\large \wan{7}\wan{8}\wan{9}} rather than trying too hard to pursue {\jap ittsu}. 
With this in mind, consider the following hand. 

\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap ittsu} 2}
\bp
\wan{1}\wan{3}\wan{5}\wan{5}\tong{4}\tong{6}\tong{6}\suo{1}\suo{3}\suo{4}\suo{6}\suo{7}\suo{9}~\tong{7}\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}
\noindent
Although we see a remote possibility of {\jap ittsu} in Bamboos, pursuing it requires we fill in three closed-wait protoruns in Bamboos: {\large\suo{1}\suo{3}}, {\large\suo{4}\suo{6}}, and {\large\suo{7}\suo{9}}.

\bigskip
It would be more realistic if we discard the {\large\suo{1}} and the {\large\suo{9}}; we would consider the tile blocks in Bamboos as a collection of two side-wait protoruns: {\large\suo{3}\suo{4}} and {\large\suo{6}\suo{7}} + two redundant terminal tiles: {\large\suo{1} \suo{9}}, rather than considering it as a collection of three closed-wait protoruns.

\newpage
\subsection{Run + side-wait protorun}

At one step prior to getting two non-overlapping runs, we may have one run and a non-overlapping side-wait protorun in a given suit. The following blocks are examples of such run + side-wait protorun combinations.

\bigskip
{\LARGE \wan{3}\wan{4}\wan{5}+\wan{7}\wan{8}}  \hfill 
{\LARGE \tong{3}\tong{4}+\tong{6}\tong{7}\tong{8}} \hfill
{\LARGE \suo{4}\suo{5}+\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}} 
\bigskip

\noindent
When we have a combination like these, a draw of a {\large\wan{1}} or a {\large\wan{2}} (left example), a {\large\tong{1}} or a {\large\tong{9}} (middle example), a {\large\suo{1}} or a {\large\suo{2}} (right example) generates a realistic probability of getting {\jap ittsu}. Below are the resulting tile blocks in each instance. You can pursue {\jap ittsu} with any of these blocks. 

\bigskip 
\begin{table}[h]\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hspace{-15pt}{\Large\wan{1}+\wan{3}\wan{4}\wan{5}+\wan{7}\wan{8}}&
{\Large\tong{1}+\tong{3}\tong{4}+\tong{6}\tong{7}\tong{8}}&
{\Large\suo{1}+\suo{4}\suo{5}+\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}}\\ [\sep]
\hspace{-15pt}{\Large\wan{2}+\wan{3}\wan{4}\wan{5}+\wan{7}\wan{8}}&
{\Large\tong{3}\tong{4}+\tong{6}\tong{7}\tong{8}+\tong{9}}&
{\Large\suo{2}+\suo{4}\suo{5}+\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\bigskip
However, if the protorun is instead a closed-wait or an edge-wait one, the chance of getting {\jap ittsu} is much diminished. The following blocks are examples of such run + closed- or edge-wait protorun combinations. You may not want to pursue {\jap ittsu} with these blocks. 

\bigskip
{\LARGE \wan{3}\wan{4}\wan{5}+\wan{8}\wan{9}}  \hfill 
{\LARGE \tong{1}\tong{2}+\tong{6}\tong{7}\tong{8}} \hfill
{\LARGE \suo{1}\suo{3}+\suo{7}\suo{8}\suo{9}} 

\bigskip
\noindent If the run becomes a bulging float block, you may want to give up on {\jap ittsu} and discard the closed- or edge-wait protorun part. With this in mind, consider the following 2-away hand.

\bigskip
\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap ittsu} 3}
\bp
\wan{1}\wan{3}\wan{4}\wan{5}\wan{8}\wan{9}\tong{5}\tong{5}\suo{3}\suo{3}\suo{6}\bai\bai~\wan{4}\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}
\noindent
Now that we drew a tile that creates a bulging float block in Cracks, it is about time to give up on {\jap ittsu}. Discarding the {\large\wan{1}} allows the hand to accept 9 kinds--25 tiles; if we stick with {\jap ittsu} and discard a {\large\wan{4}}, the hand can accept only 4 kinds--10 tiles. 

\bigskip
Moreover, although the hand is 2-away from ready, it is 3-away from {\jap ittsu}. Pursuing {\jap ittsu} with a hand like this is not very practical.

\newpage
\subsection{{\jap Ittsu} vs. side wait}

\end{itembox}
\noindent
If we discard the {\large\wan{1}} we drew, the hand is a perfect 1-away hand; the final wait can always be side wait. On the other hand, if we discard a {\large\wan{5}}, we have a confirmed {\jap ittsu} hand. Which option should we choose?

\bigskip
If we compare tile acceptance counts for the two scenarios, the option of confirming side wait is slightly better (6 kinds--18 tiles vs. 5 kinds--16 tiles). However, doing so means we give up on {\jap ittsu} that is already here. Moreover, giving up on {\jap ittsu} means that we can never call {\jap pon} or {\jap chii} with this hand because there is no {\jap yaku} in the hand. On the other hand, the second option allows us to call {\jap pon} on any of {\large\tong{5}\suo{1}} or call {\jap chii} on a {\large\wan{2}}. 
Even though the kinds and the number of acceptable tiles are smaller, the second option would be more efficient if we take melding into account. 

\section{How to get {\jap pinfu}} \index{pinfu@{\jap pinfu}}\label{sec:pinfu}

Although {\jap pinfu} is only worth one {\jap fan}, the requirements to claim {\jap pinfu} are rather demanding. The key to getting {\jap pinfu} is to build side-wait protoruns even at the cost of tile efficiency. Consider the following hand. 
\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap pinfu} 1}
\bp
\wan{2}\wan{3}\wan{5}\wan{5}\wan{8}\wan{9}\tong{4}\tong{7}\tong{8}\suo{2}\suo{3}\suo{4}\suo{6}~\wan{1}\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}
\noindent
We already have five tile blocks in this hand. From a pure tile efficiency perspective, discarding one of the two floating tiles {\large\tong{4}} or the {\large\suo{6}} is the best. However, doing so significantly reduces our chance of getting {\jap pinfu}. If we aim for {\jap pinfu} we should discard the edge-wait protorun {\large\wan{8}\wan{9}} and keep the two floating tiles, which we hope may grow into a side-wait protorun. 

\bigskip
Suppose we discarded the {\large\wan{8}}, then we drew a {\large\tong{5}}, after which we discarded the {\large\wan{9}}. Now the hand is 1-away again, this time with two side-wait protoruns. Suppose further that we drew a {\large\xi}. 
\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap pinfu} 2}
\bp
\wan{1}\wan{2}\wan{3}\wan{5}\wan{5}\tong{4}\tong{5}\tong{7}\tong{8}\suo{2}\suo{3}\suo{4}\suo{6}~\xi\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}
\noindent
We should keep the {\large\xi} as a safe tile and discard the {\large\suo{6}}. It is true that keeping the {\large\suo{6}} has an advantage; if we draw a {\large\suo{5}}, we will get a 3-way side-wait block in Bamboos. Even a draw of a {\large\suo{7}} improves this hand slightly. This is because having {\large\tong{4}\tong{5}} and {\large\tong{7}\tong{8}} is not very efficient due to the overlap of the waiting tiles; both blocks wait for a {\large\tong{6}}. It would be better to have {\large\suo{6}\suo{7}} and {\large\tong{4}\tong{5}}, rather than having {\large\tong{4}\tong{5}} and {\large\tong{7}\tong{8}}.

\bigskip
However, keeping the {\large\suo{6}} comes at a cost. Even when we draw a {\large\suo{5}}, we will then have to discard {\large\tong{4}\tong{5}} or {\large\tong{7}\tong{8}}, possibly against an opponent's {\jap riichi}. 
Therefore, once we get a 1-away with two side-wait protoruns ({\bf side 'n' side 1-away}; {\jap ryanmen-ryanmen 1-shanten}), we should try to keep a safety tile in the hand.
\index{1-away (1-{\jap shanten})!side 'n' side 1-away}

\bigskip
Even when we draw a tile that makes a hand perfect 1-away, we may still want to have a safety tile. For example, drawing any of {\large\tong{4}\tong{5}\tong{7}\tong{8}} makes the hand above perfect 1-away. 
\index{1-away (1-{\jap shanten})!perfect 1-away}
Although perfect 1-away is better than side 'n' side 1-away in terms of tile acceptance, a perfect 1-away hand can end up not having {\jap pinfu} because a set can emerge in the hand. 

\vfill
There is one exception to this, however. If the floating tile leaves a possibility of enhancing the hand value by at least three {\jap fan}, it is OK to keep it instead of a safety tile. Consider the following hand. 
\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap pinfu} 3}
\bp
\wan{1}\wan{2}\wan{3}\wan{5}\wan{7}\wan{8}\wan{9}\tong{3}\tong{4}\tong{7}\tong{7}\suo{2}\suo{3}~\xi~\wan{4}\\
\hspace{283pt}\footnotesize{Draw}~\footnotesize{\jap Dora}
\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}

\bigskip
\noindent Keeping the {\large\xi} is safer, but keeping the {\large\wan{5}} leaves the possibilities of getting {\jap ittsu} and having {\jap dora}, possibly at the same time. In this case, we would rather discard the {\large\xi}. 

\newpage

\subsubsection{Building the head}
To claim {\jap pinfu}, the head must be a pair of number tiles or valueless Wind tiles. Therefore, try not to discard terminals or valueless Wind tiles lightly when having a {\jap pinfu} hand. Keep this in mind especially when a hand is lacking any pair. Assuming you are the South player in the 1st turn in East-1, consider the following hand. 
\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap pinfu} 4}
\bp
\wan{1}\wan{4}\wan{6}\tong{2}\tong{3}\tong{6}\tong{7}\tong{9}\suo{5}\suo{6}\suo{6}\suo{7}\xi\fa
\ep
\vspace{-10pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}

\bigskip
\noindent The hand has a potential to have {\jap pinfu}, so we should not discard any of {\large\wan{1}\tong{9}\xi} at this point. All of these three tiles may appear useless, but they can be the head of a {\jap pinfu} hand when any of them grows into a pair. On the other hand, the value tile {\large\fa} cannot be the head of {\jap pinfu}. We should discard the {\large\fa} in this case.

\section{How to get {\jap honitsu}}\label{sec:hon}
	\index{honitsu@{\jap honitsu} (Half Flush)}
Going for {\jap honitsu} (Half Flush) can be a good way to achieve high hand values. As we can combine {\jap honitsu} with many other {\jap yaku}, including {\jap fanpai}, {\jap toitoi}, {\jap chanta} (Outside Hand), {\jap ittsu}, among others,\footnote{Technically speaking, {\jap honitsu} can be combined with {\jap chiitoitsu}, {\jap shousangen} (Little Three Dragons), {\jap honroutou} (All Terminals and Honors), {\jap pinfu}, {\jap iipeiko}, {\jap ryanpeiko}, {\jap san ankou} (Three Concealed Pungs), and {\jap san kantsu} (Three Kongs) as well.}
we can aim for {\jap mangan} relatively easily.
The fact that {\jap honitsu} is worth two {\jap fan} even when we meld our hand means we can also enhance the speed by melding without making our hand too cheap.

\subsection{Conditions to go for {\jap honitsu}}
When judging whether to go for {\jap honitsu} or not, we should consider two factors --- five-block potential and hand values with and without {\jap honitsu}.

\subsubsection{1. Five-block potential}
\noindent The most important factor to consider is whether or not your hand has  five tile blocks or block candidates (i.e., floating tiles) necessary for {\jap honitsu}. Assuming you are the South player in the 6th turn in East-1, consider the following hand. 

\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap honitsu} 1}
\bp
\wan{1}\wan{5}\wan{5}\wan{7}\wan{9}\tong{8}\suo{2}\suo{4}\dong\dong\xi\zhong\zhong
\ep
\vspace{-10pt}Would you go for {\jap honitsu}? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}
\noindent
In order to figure out if it is practical to pursue {\jap honitsu} with this hand, let's apply the five-block method. 
\bmj{\huge
$ 
\underbrace{\text{\wan{5}\wan{5}}}
\underbrace{\text{\wan{7}\wan{9}}}
\underbrace{\text{\dong\dong}}
\underbrace{\text{\zhong\zhong}}
\underbrace{\text{\wan{1}\xi}}
\text{\tong{8}\suo{2}\suo{4}}
\nonumber
$
}\emj
We can count on the two pairs of {\jap fanpai}, {\large\dong\dong} and {\large\zhong\zhong}, to be two tile blocks, a pair of {\large\wan{5}\wan{5}} and a protorun {\large\wan{7}\wan{9}} to be another two blocks, yielding four blocks in total. In addition, we can reasonably expect either of the two floating tiles {\large\xi} or {\large\wan{1}} to produce the fifth block. Therefore, you can go for {\jap honitsu} with this hand. 

\bigskip
In addition, the tiles that are made redundant in the hand if we choose {\jap honitsu} are an isolated {\large\tong{8}} and a closed-wait protorun {\large\suo{2}\suo{4}}. We can go for {\jap honitsu} without much hesitation. 

\bigskip
Even when we have a side-wait protorun or a pair to discard, we may still want to go for {\jap honitsu}. For example, with the following two hands, you should go for {\jap honitsu} even though doing so means you have to discard a side-wait protorun or a pair. 
\bp
\wan{2}\wan{3}\tong{1}\tong{3}\tong{4}\tong{5}\tong{5}\tong{6}\tong{8}\tong{8}\xi\bai\bai\bai\\
\tong{4}\tong{4}\suo{1}\suo{2}\suo{4}\suo{4}\suo{5}\suo{5}\suo{9}\dong\nan\nan\bei\zhong
\ep

\subsubsection{2. Hand value}

Another factor to consider is hand value comparison with and without {\jap honitsu}. If your hand does not have any {\jap yaku} potential (e.g., pair or set of {\jap fanpai}) other than {\jap honitsu}, you may end up getting a {\jap honitsu}-only hand, which is very cheap (2000 or 2600 points). In such situations, you should not aim for {\jap honitsu}; you should try to make the hand ready without melding and go for {\jap riichi}. Assuming you are the South player in East-1, consider the following hand.
\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap honitsu} 2}
\bp
\wan{1}\wan{2}\wan{4}\wan{6}\wan{8}\wan{8}\tong{4}\tong{5}\suo{7}\suo{7}\xi\xi\bei\bei
\ep
\vspace{-10pt}Would you go for {\jap honitsu}? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}
\noindent
Since West and North are both valueless Wind tiles, this hand is likely to become {\jap honitsu}-only if you decide to go for {\jap honitsu}. Although this hand has five tile blocks necessary for {\jap honitsu}, you should not go for {\jap honitsu}. 

\bigskip
At the same time, when the hand value is sufficiently high ($\geq$ 5200) \emph{without} {\jap honitsu}, you should not go for \\{\jap honitsu} at the cost of tile efficiency. Assuming you are the South player in East-1, consider the following hand.\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap honitsu} 3}
\bp \vspace{-10pt}
\hspace{-170pt}{\footnotesize\color{red!75!black} Red}\\ \vspace{-18pt}
\wan{1}\wan{1}\wan{4}\rfw\wan{7}\tong{3}\tong{4}\fa\fa\fa\xi~~\nan\nan\rnan
\ep
\vspace{-10pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}

\bigskip
\noindent This hand is worth 5200 points without {\jap honitsu} (Seat Wind + Green Dragon + red five), so you should discard the {\large\wan{7}} to maintain a side 'n' side 1-away status. If {\large\nan} were not your Seat Wind, you should go for {\jap honitsu}.

\newpage
\subsection{Discard}
When pursuing {\jap honitsu}, pay attention to the order of your discards. 
Consider the following hand. You called {\jap pon} on a {\large\bai} just now, deciding what to discard. 
\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap honitsu} 4}
\bp
\wan{1}\wan{1}\wan{2}\wan{6}\wan{8}\tong{7}\suo{3}\suo{5}\bei\bei\zhong~\bai\bai\rbai
\ep
\vspace{-10pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}

\bigskip
\noindent You should pursue {\jap honitsu}, so {\large\tong{7}\suo{3}\suo{5}} are your discard candidates. You will discard all three of them eventually, but you should discard them in a way that looks less obvious that you are collecting tiles in Cracks. 
If you discard the {\large\tong{7}} first then the {\large\suo{5}} next, the opponents might (correctly) guess that you are pursuing {\jap honitsu} in Cracks. 
In particular, the Left player may stop discarding tiles in Cracks that you could call {\jap chii} on. You should thus discard the {\large\suo{5}} first then the {\large\suo{3}} next, so that the opponents cannot know if you are collecting Cracks or Dots. They will eventually find out that you are collecting the Cracks, but you should delay that as much as possible. 

\newpage
\subsection{Melding}
When you start melding with a {\jap honitsu} hand, try to leave the possibility of achieving the maximum hand value. Assuming you are the South player in the 6th turn in East-1, consider the following hand.

\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap honitsu} 5}
\bp
\wan{9}\wan{9}\tong{2}\tong{3}\tong{5}\tong{7}\tong{8}\tong{9}\xi\bei\bei\fa\fa
\ep
\vspace{-10pt}Which tile would you call? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}

\bigskip
\noindent With this hand, do not start melding with a {\jap chii} of {\large\tong{4}} or a {\jap pon} of {\large\bei}; you may end up with a very cheap (2000 points) {\jap honitsu}-only hand. 
Suppose you managed to call {\jap pon} on a {\large\fa}, resulting in the following hand. 

\bp
\wan{9}\tong{2}\tong{3}\tong{5}\tong{7}\tong{8}\tong{9}\xi\bei\bei~\fa\rfa\fa
\ep

\noindent Calling {\jap chii} on a {\large\tong{4}} or {\jap pon} on a {\large\bei} is still not ideal. The only melding you should do is to call {\jap chii} on a {\large\tong{1}} to have the following hand.

\bp
\tong{5}\tong{7}\tong{8}\tong{9}\xi\bei\bei~\rtong{1}\tong{2}\tong{3}~\fa\rfa\fa
\ep

Notice that the two floating tiles {\large\tong{5} \xi} allow us to envision two possibilities of getting a 7700 hand. 
On the one hand, if you draw a {\large\xi} or call {\jap pon} on a {\large\bei}, you get {\jap honitsu} + Green Dragon + {\jap chanta} (Outside Hand), as follows.

\bp
\tong{7}\tong{8}\tong{9}\xi\xi\bei\bei~\rtong{1}\tong{2}\tong{3}~\fa\rfa\fa\\
\tong{7}\tong{8}\tong{9}\xi~\bei\bei\rbei~\rtong{1}\tong{2}\tong{3}~\fa\rfa\fa
\ep

On the other hand, if you draw a {\large\tong{4}} or a {\large\tong{6}}, the hand will be ready for {\jap honitsu} + Green Dragon + {\jap ittsu}. 

\bp
\tong{4}\tong{5}\tong{7}\tong{8}\tong{9}\bei\bei~\rtong{1}\tong{2}\tong{3}~\fa\rfa\fa\\
\tong{5}\tong{6}\tong{7}\tong{8}\tong{9}\bei\bei~\rtong{1}\tong{2}\tong{3}~\fa\rfa\fa
\ep

\newpage
\section{How to get {\jap toitoi} / {\jap chiitoitsu}} \label{sec:toi}

\subsection{{\jap Toitoi} vs. {\jap chiitoitsu}}
	\index{chiitoitsu@{\jap chiitoitsu} (Seven Pairs)}
	\index{toitoi@{\jap toitoi} (All Pungs)}
When pursuing {\jap chiitoitsu} (Seven Pairs), you may find yourself standing at a crossroad between {\jap chiitoitsu} and {\jap toitoi} (All Pungs). Specifically, what should we do when one of the pairs in a 1-away {\jap chiitoitsu} hand becomes a set? Assuming you are the South player in the 6th turn in East-1, consider the following hand. 

\bigskip
\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap toitoi} vs. {\jap chiitoitsu}}
\bp
\wan{7}\wan{7}\wan{8}\wan{8}\tong{1}\tong{3}\tong{3}\suo{5}\suo{5}\suo{7}\fa\fa\bei~\tong{3}\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}

\bigskip
\noindent If we discard the {\large\tong{3}} that we drew, the hand is 1-away from ready for {\jap chiitoitsu}, accepting {\large\tong{1}\suo{7}\bei} (3 kinds--9 tiles). On the other hand, if we keep it and discard the {\large\suo{7}} instead, the hand is still a 1-away {\jap chiitoitsu} hand, albeit with smaller tile acceptance. However, doing so makes the hand also 2-away from ready for {\jap toitoi} and possibly {\jap su anko} (Four Concealed Pungs). 

\bigskip
\noindent Judgement criteria for a choice of this kind are summarized as follows.
\bigskip
\begin{itembox}[c]{{\jap Toitoi} vs. {\jap chiitoitsu}}
Choose {\jap chiitoitsu} in the following situations.
\be\itemsep.1pt
\i There is a futile pair in your hand.
\i There is no pair of value tiles in your hand.
\i There are three or more pairs of simple tiles between 3 and 7 in your hand.
\ee
\end{itembox}

\bigskip
\noindent The first condition is by far the most important one. With the current hand example, if the opponents have already discarded two tiles of {\large\wan{7}}, the pair of {\large\wan{7}} in the hand is a {\bf futile pair} (dead pair) that will never become a set. If there is one or more futile pair in your hand, you must stick with {\jap chiitoitsu}. If not, you can go for {\jap toitoi}. 

\bigskip
In addition, you may also want to take into account the second and the third conditions. Specifically, without having a pair of value tiles ({\jap fanpai}), you may end up with a {\jap toitoi}-only hand (2600 or even 2000 points). With one pair of value tiles, you can aim for 5200 with {\jap toitoi}; with two pairs of them, you can aim for {\jap mangan}. 

\bigskip
The third factor to consider is whether there are \emph{not} three or more pairs of simple tiles between 3 and 7. Consider the following hand. 
\bp
\wan{6}\wan{7}\wan{7}\tong{5}\tong{5}\suo{2}\suo{2}\suo{6}\suo{6}\bai\bai\fa\zhong
\ep
Suppose you start melding by calling {\jap pon} on a {\large\bai},\footnote{Calling {\jap pon} on a {\bai} makes this 1-away {\jap chiitoitsu} hand 2-away from ready for {\jap toitoi}. Doing so would be acceptable if the remaining pairs were not simple tiles between 3 and 7.} then get another {\jap pon} on a {\large\suo{2}}, resulting in the following hand.
\bp
\wan{7}\wan{7}\tong{5}\tong{5}\suo{6}\suo{6}\zhong~\suo{2}\suo{2}\rsuo{2}~\bai\rbai\bai
\ep
Since the remaining three pairs are all simple tiles between 3 and 7, the hand advancement often stops here. Because of their high versatility, simple tiles between 3 and 7 are very likely to be used by the opponents. 

\newpage
\subsection{Standard hand vs. {\jap chiitoitsu}}
Another kind of crossroad is between {\jap chiitoitsu} and standard hand. Assuming you are the South player in the 6th turn in East-1, consider the following hand. 
\bigskip
\begin{itembox}[r]{{\jap pinfu} vs. {\jap chiitoitsu}}
\bp
\wan{4}\wan{5}\wan{6}\wan{6}\tong{4}\tong{5}\tong{8}\tong{8}\suo{6}\suo{6}\suo{7}\bei\bei~\wan{5}\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}

\bigskip
\noindent As we draw a {\large\wan{5}}, we now have five pairs in the hand, making it 1-away from ready for {\jap chiitoitsu}. However, the hand is also 2-away from ready if we interpret this hand as a standard hand. 

\bigskip
When a hand has this many side-wait protoruns, it makes more sense to view it as a standard hand rather than as a {\jap chiitoitsu} hand. To figure out what tile to discard, let's apply the five-block method. 

\bmj{\huge
$ 
\underbrace{\text{\wan{4}\wan{5}\wan{5}\wan{6}\wan{6}}}_{\text{\small 2}}
\underbrace{\text{\tong{4}\tong{5}}}
\underbrace{\text{\tong{8}\tong{8}}}
\underbrace{\text{\suo{6}\suo{6}\suo{7}}}
\text{\bei\bei}
\nonumber
$
}\emj
Since we already have five tile blocks in simple tiles, the pair of {\large\bei} is redundant. Discarding a {\large\bei} means we are giving up on {\jap chiitoitsu}, but we are maximizing tile acceptance to make the hand ready for {\jap tanyao} as soon as possible. Doing so leaves a decent chance of getting {\jap pinfu} and {\jap iipeiko} as well. The expected hand value will actually be higher if we give up on {\jap chiitoitsu}.

\bigskip
On the other hand, when a hand has few side-wait protoruns but has several pairs, you should pursue a pair-based (set-based) hand rather than a run-based hand. Assuming you are the South player in the 6th turn in East-1, consider the following hand. 

\bigskip
\begin{itembox}[r]{Run-based hand vs. set-based hand}
\bp
\wan{1}\wan{1}\wan{2}\wan{2}\tong{4}\tong{5}\suo{2}\suo{4}\suo{9}\suo{9}\dong\nan\bai~\bai\\
\hspace{290pt}\footnotesize{Draw}
\ep
\vspace{-17pt}What would you discard? \vspace{-5pt}
\end{itembox}

\bigskip
\noindent Although the hand has one side-wait protorun, we would not be very happy if it were to evolve into a complete run; we may end up with a very cheap hand with a bad wait. Alternatively, you should pursue {\jap chiitoitsu} or {\jap toitoi} with a hand like this. Let's apply the five-block method to figure out what tile to discard.

\bmj{\huge
$ 
\underbrace{\text{\wan{1}\wan{1}}}
\underbrace{\text{\wan{2}\wan{2}}}
\underbrace{\text{\suo{9}\suo{9}}}
\underbrace{\text{\bai\bai}}
\text{\tong{4}\tong{5}\suo{2}\suo{4}\dong\nan}
\nonumber
$
}\emj
Since we intend to build four blocks using the four pairs in the hand, we only need one more block from the rest of the tiles: {\large\tong{4}\tong{5}\suo{2}\suo{4}\dong\nan}. Of these six tiles, {\large\dong\nan\suo{2}} are clearly more valuable than others because of their \emph{low} versatilities. On the other hand, {\large\tong{4}\tong{5}\suo{4}} are less useful for you because these tiles have high versatility for the opponents. We should discard {\large\tong{4}} or {\large\suo{4}} first, keeping the {\large\tong{5}} just in case we draw a red {\large\rfd} (in which case the hand is 1-away from ready for {\jap chiitoitsu}).
